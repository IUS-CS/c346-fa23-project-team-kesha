## Retro

[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)
### Good

* Discord group chat for communicating is still working out fine
* Our roles seem to be developing a bit more
* TODO list was kept up to date for the most part

### Bad

* Sprint planning was poor again

### Actionable Commitments

* We need to meet as a group a bit more than we do

## Planning
