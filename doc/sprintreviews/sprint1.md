## Retro

 

[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good

* Discord group chat for communicating  

### Bad

* Sprint planning was poor 
* TODO list was not kept up to date

### Actionable Commitments

* Assign story points to members to improve planning
* Keep TODO list current
