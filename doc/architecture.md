## Meta
    We will be using Meta to retrieve user data that includes the liked posts of a facebook user.

## JS
    We will be using javascript to handle accessing these objects and filtering by keywords.

## Home Website
    This will be the URI that provides the Meta Login credentials to the Script.

## Redirect Website
    This will be the page that will display our content and filter by keyword. User will be able to input said keyword here and search for posts.

## Database/Program
    Here we will handle the objects and this is where the program will be doing the action of filtering content.
