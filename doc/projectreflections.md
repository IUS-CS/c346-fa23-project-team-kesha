# Project Reflections

### Noah Trejo
I chose a terrible first project and it honestly killed us, but we're scraping together something new. I really tried to get some data off the web to at least test with, but that didn't even work out. New project, I've made a download program that gives us mp3 files and now using tkinter for the GUI. Gonna use a local filesystem reader to update playlists and such. I think the most important part of the project was really picking something that we could actually do, and I didn't take the time to think that far ahead. The hierarchical class system of the files we are gonna use for playlists is the new architecture that we'll be using.

### Ethan Bilyk
This has honestly been a poor project experience solely due to Facebook's API permissions. They didn't give us access to what we need, so we had to swap to a new project. However, for the Meta project, I set up the GUI and login/authentication process for the users. I also have been doing our sprint#.md files regularly.
