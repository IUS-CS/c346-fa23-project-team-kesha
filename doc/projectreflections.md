# Project Reflections

### Noah Trejo
I chose a terrible first project and it honestly killed us, but we're scraping together something new. I really tried to get some data off the web to at least test with, but that didn't even work out. New project, I've made a download program that gives us mp3 files and now using tkinter for the GUI. Gonna use a local filesystem reader to update playlists and such. I think the most important part of the project was really picking something that we could actually do, and I didn't take the time to think that far ahead. The hierarchical class system of the files we are gonna use for playlists is the new architecture that we'll be using.

### Ethan Bilyk
This has honestly been a poor project experience solely due to Facebook's API permissions. They didn't give us access to what we needed, so we had to swap to a new project. However, for the Meta project, I set up the GUI and login/authentication process for the users. I also have been doing our sprint#.md files regularly.

This project was a little hard since we tried using an API from Facebook. This led to us having to learn how it worked. Also, we couldn't find a way to get authorization from Facebook for more of their tools. These tools would have helped us in our original project. Because of this, we had to switch projects to what we are currently doing which seems to be easier. Hopefully, we won't run into any other major problems with this new one.
